Welcome to iPLayer.

This player is a terminal player which can list track you have (by default seven song from fabulous Johnny Hallyday are available).

To navigate into menu, tap the caps character of menu you see.

For example, A to add a track, Q to quit for the first menu.

And for the second menu : B to come back, E to listen the previous song and N to listen the next.

There are not so much capabilities but I do that for the fun, essentially.
